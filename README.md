# Concurrent requests

I Decided to keep the sturcture of the test as is was sent out. The application created is actually in wsd-final folder. I was unsure if the wsd-proxy-test(2) were going to be needed by white swan data for testing purposes. 

Any questions on the Code/Implementation please just ask!

Cheers
